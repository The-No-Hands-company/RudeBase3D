# Viewport Camera Controller Architecture Overhaul

## Overview
Complete redesign of the camera/viewport system to follow industry standards used in Maya, Blender, 3ds Max, and modern CAD applications.

## Current Issues
1. **Limited Navigation Styles**: Only Maya-style fully implemented
2. **Tight Coupling**: Camera controller tightly coupled to input handling
3. **Missing Standard Features**: No camera bookmarks, viewport layouts, snap-to-grid
4. **Inconsistent Orbit Behavior**: Users report "weird" feeling orbit controls
5. **Grid/Lighting Disconnection**: Systems work independently, not cohesively

## New Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Viewport Manager
- **Multi-Viewport Support**: 1x1, 2x2, 1x3 layouts like industry tools
- **Per-Viewport Camera**: Each viewport has independent camera state
- **Synchronized Views**: Option to link/sync camera movements across viewports
- **Viewport Types**: Perspective, Top, Front, Right, User views

#### 2. Camera Controller Strategy Pattern
- **ICameraController Interface**: Pluggable camera control strategies
- **MayaCameraController**: Traditional Maya Alt+Mouse controls
- **BlenderCameraController**: MMB-based Blender controls  
- **CADCameraController**: Right-click orbit, professional CAD workflow
- **GameCameraController**: WASD + Mouse look for architecture walkthroughs
- **CustomCameraController**: User-configurable control schemes

#### 3. Camera State Management
- **Camera Bookmarks**: Save/restore camera positions (1-9 keys)
- **View History**: Navigate back/forward through view changes
- **Focus System**: Intelligent frame-to-object with proper distance calculation
- **Orbit Pivot Management**: Visual pivot indicator, smart pivot selection

#### 4. Professional Viewport Features
- **Gizmo System**: Industry-standard transform gizmos
- **Grid Snapping**: Snap camera movement to grid increments
- **View Cubes**: Interactive 3D navigation widget (like AutoCAD/3ds Max)
- **Safe Frames**: Camera safe areas for animation/rendering
- **Viewport Shading**: Multiple shading modes per viewport

#### 5. Lighting Integration
- **Per-Viewport Lighting**: Independent lighting setups per viewport
- **Camera-Relative Lighting**: Lights that follow camera (headlight mode)
- **Environment Lighting**: HDR environment maps and skyboxes
- **Shadow Previews**: Real-time shadow preview in viewport

#### 6. Grid System Enhancements  
- **Adaptive Detail**: Grid detail adjusts based on camera distance
- **Multi-Plane Grids**: XY, XZ, YZ planes with user-defined orientations
- **Snap Indicators**: Visual feedback for grid/object snapping
- **Construction Planes**: User-defined work planes like CAD software

## Implementation Status

### ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETED: Core Camera System
1. ✅ **ICameraController Interface**: Complete strategy pattern implementation
2. ✅ **CameraStateManager**: Camera bookmarks, history, and pivot management  
3. ✅ **MayaCameraController**: Professional Maya-style navigation controls
4. ✅ **ViewportManager**: Multi-viewport layout system with 1x1, 2x2, 1x3 support
5. ✅ **ViewportWidget**: Individual viewport with independent camera and rendering
6. ✅ **Integration**: MainWindow and UIManager fully refactored to use new system

## ✅ Phase 1 Complete - Build Status: SUCCESS

The core viewport architecture overhaul has been successfully completed and compiled! The project now features:

### Implemented Components
- **ICameraController**: Strategy pattern interface for camera navigation
- **CameraStateManager**: Camera bookmarks, history, and pivot management
- **MayaCameraController**: Professional Maya-style navigation with Alt+Mouse controls
- **ViewportManager**: Multi-viewport layout manager (Single, Quad, Triple, Dual layouts)
- **ViewportWidget**: Individual viewport with independent camera and OpenGL rendering
- **ViewCube**: Navigation widget foundation for professional 3D navigation

### Integration Complete
- **MainWindow**: Fully refactored to use ViewportManager instead of legacy Viewport3D
- **UIManager**: Updated to create and manage ViewportManager with single viewport layout
- **CMakeLists.txt**: Automatically includes new files via GLOB_RECURSE
- **Build System**: Successfully compiles with Qt6 and OpenGL integration

### Technical Achievements
- **Decoupled Architecture**: Camera, viewport, and rendering systems properly separated
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable camera controller system ready for expansion
- **Signal-Slot Integration**: Clean Qt signal connections for UI updates
- **OpenGL Integration**: ViewportWidget inherits QOpenGLWidget and QOpenGLFunctions
- **Memory Management**: Smart pointers throughout for safe resource handling

The foundation is now in place for the remaining phases: additional camera controllers, advanced viewport features, and professional polish.

## Next Phases

#### Phase 2: Additional Camera Controllers  
- **BlenderCameraController**: MMB-based Blender controls
- **CADCameraController**: Right-click orbit, professional CAD workflow
- **GameCameraController**: WASD + Mouse look for architecture walkthroughs
- **CustomCameraController**: User-configurable control schemes

#### Phase 3: Advanced Viewport Features
- **ViewCube Widget**: Interactive 3D navigation widget (like AutoCAD/3ds Max)
- **Advanced Gizmo System**: Industry-standard transform gizmos
- **Grid Snapping**: Snap camera movement to grid increments  
- **Construction Planes**: User-defined work planes like CAD software

#### Phase 4: Professional Polish
- **Camera Bookmarks UI**: Visual bookmark management interface
- **Viewport Synchronization**: Link/sync camera movements across viewports
- **Performance Optimization**: Frustum culling, level-of-detail
- **User Preferences**: Settings persistence and workflow presets

## Expected Benefits

1. **User Choice**: Multiple navigation styles to match user preferences
2. **Industry Standard**: Familiar workflows from professional tools
3. **Robustness**: Decoupled, testable, maintainable architecture
4. **Performance**: Optimized rendering and interaction systems
5. **Professional Feel**: Smooth, predictable camera behavior
6. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new navigation modes and features

## Technical Details

- **Decoupled Design**: Camera, input, rendering systems communicate via signals
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable navigation behaviors
- **State Management**: Proper separation of camera state and controller logic
- **Event System**: Clean event propagation for UI updates
- **Performance**: Frustum culling, level-of-detail, async operations
- **Memory Safety**: Smart pointer management, RAII principles

This architecture will provide the robust, industry-standard viewport system that RudeBase3D needs for professional 3D modeling work.
