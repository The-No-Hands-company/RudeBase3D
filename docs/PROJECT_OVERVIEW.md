## Technical Architecture

### **Rendering Pipeline**
- OpenGL 3.3+ with modern shader-based rendering
- Vertex Array Objects (VAO) for efficient geometry
- Separate shaders for solid and wireframe rendering
- Matrix-based transform hierarchy
- Real-time lighting with Phong shading model

### **Object System**
- Component-based architecture (Transform, Mesh, Material)
- Shared pointer management for memory safety
- Signal-slot communication for UI updates
- Bounding box calculations for camera framing

### **UI Framework**
- Qt6 Widgets for native desktop integration
- OpenGL integration via QOpenGLWidget
- Model-View architecture for scene hierarchy
- Property binding for real-time updates

## Key Classes and Their Roles

| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `MainWindow` | Main application window, menu/toolbar management |
| `Viewport3D` | 3D rendering surface, camera controls, object picking |
| `Scene` | Container for all 3D objects, selection management |
| `SceneObject` | Individual 3D objects with transform, mesh, material |
| `Camera` | 3D camera with perspective projection and controls |
| `Transform` | Position, rotation, scale with matrix operations |
| `Mesh` | 3D geometry data with OpenGL buffer management |

## Building and Running

### **Prerequisites**
- Qt 6.x with OpenGL support
- CMake 3.20+ (for C++23 support)
- Visual Studio 2022 (for C++23 support)
- OpenGL 3.3+ compatible graphics card

### **Build Steps**
1. **Windows with VS2022**: Run `build.bat` or use the VS Code build task
2. **Alternative**: 
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=23
   cmake --build . --config Release
