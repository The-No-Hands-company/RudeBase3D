# Project Governance

## üèõÔ∏è Governance Model

RudeBase3D follows an **open governance model** that encourages community participation while maintaining clear decision-making processes and code quality standards.

## üëë Leadership Structure

### **Project Leadership**
- **Project Lead**: Responsible for overall project direction and strategic decisions
- **Technical Lead**: Oversees technical architecture and core development decisions
- **Community Manager**: Manages community relations, documentation, and outreach

### **Core Team**
Core team members have commit access to the main repository and guide the project's technical direction:
- **Maintainers**: Responsible for specific modules/subsystems
- **Senior Contributors**: Experienced contributors with deep project knowledge
- **Release Managers**: Coordinate releases and version management

### **Advisory Board** (Future)
As the project grows, we may establish an advisory board consisting of:
- Industry experts in 3D graphics and modeling
- Representatives from major user communities
- Technical experts in relevant domains

## üó≥Ô∏è Decision Making Process

### **Consensus Building**
- **Minor Changes**: Direct commits by core team members
- **Moderate Changes**: Pull request review by at least 2 core team members
- **Major Changes**: RFC (Request for Comments) process with community input
- **Breaking Changes**: Require broader consensus and deprecation period

### **RFC Process**
For significant changes affecting architecture, public APIs, or user experience:

1. **Draft RFC**: Create detailed proposal in `rfcs/` directory
2. **Community Discussion**: 2-week discussion period on GitHub Discussions
3. **Core Team Review**: Technical feasibility and alignment assessment
4. **Decision**: Formal acceptance/rejection with reasoning
5. **Implementation**: Coordinated development following approved RFC

### **Conflict Resolution**
1. **Discussion**: Open dialogue to understand different perspectives
2. **Mediation**: Core team member facilitates resolution
3. **Escalation**: Project Lead makes final decision if needed
4. **Appeal**: Community can appeal decisions through formal process

## üéØ Project Roles and Responsibilities
