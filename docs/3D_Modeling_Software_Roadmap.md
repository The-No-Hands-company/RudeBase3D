- **Documentation**: Comprehensive user and API docs from the start.
- **Testing**: Rigorous unit and stress testing for kernel and tools.

## 17. Additional Notes
- **Inspiration**: Study Blender for artistic workflows, Plasticity for precision, and tools like ZBrush, Houdini, and Fusion 360 for specific features.
- **User Feedback**: Engage artists, designers, and engineers via beta testing and platforms like Canny (https://plasticity.canny.io/feature-requests).
- **Scalability**: Plan for large-scale projects (e.g., architectural models, game assets).
- **Future-Proofing**: Support emerging technologies (e.g., AI, AR/VR, cloud rendering).

This roadmap provides a complete blueprint for building a 3D modeling software that combines artistic flexibility with advanced precision, covering every aspect from kernel to collaboration.
