- **Investigation**: Complete initial assessment within 7 days
- **Resolution**: 
  - Critical vulnerabilities: 30 days maximum
  - High severity: 60 days maximum
  - Medium/Low severity: 90 days maximum

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report
- We will provide an estimated timeline for addressing the vulnerability
- We will notify you when the vulnerability is fixed
- We may request that you keep the vulnerability confidential until we've had a chance to address it

### Security Considerations

RudeBase3D handles:
- **File I/O**: Loading untrusted 3D model files (OBJ, FBX, etc.)
- **Plugin System**: Loading third-party plugins and scripts
- **Network Operations**: Potential future cloud features
- **User Input**: Handling potentially malicious user input

Common security concerns include:
- Memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free)
- File format parsing vulnerabilities
- Plugin sandbox escapes
- Input validation failures

### Security Best Practices

When contributing to RudeBase3D:
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all input data
- Use safe memory management (RAII, smart pointers)
- Avoid unsafe C functions
- Review third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Use static analysis tools when available

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our security:
- Security researchers will be credited in our security advisories (unless they prefer to remain anonymous)
- We maintain a security researchers hall of fame
- For significant findings, we may offer recognition rewards (to be determined)

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible after verification
- Documented in our changelog and security advisories
- Announced through our official communication channels
- Tagged with appropriate version bumps following semantic versioning
